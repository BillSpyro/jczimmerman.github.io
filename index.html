      <h2>Hey!</h1>
      <p>I am Joey. I am 20 years old, born and raised in Willow Street,
      Pennsylvania. I am the youngest of four siblings. I have 2 older sisters
      and 1 older brother. I am a student at Thaddeus Stevens, currently
      enrolled in the Computer Software Engineering Technologies program.
      Ever since I was a little kid, I wanted to be a software developer.
      I believe my love for technology and computers started when I was
      a young boy. I remember sitting infront of our big clunky Windows
      PC for hours just messing around with anything I could find because it was
      so intriguing to me. That same interest and love for technology
      still resides in me today.</p>

      <h2>What skill I offer</h2>
      <p>Only a couple weeks into my progam, I currently have a solid foundation
      of understanding for the command line, the use of git and how to react
      when running into certain situations with git, how to write semantic HTML,
      and a solid groundwork of CSS.
