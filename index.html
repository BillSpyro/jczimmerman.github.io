      <h2>Hi, I'm Joseph.</h1>
      <p>I am a student at Thaddeus Stevens, currently enrolled in
      the Computer Software Engineering Technologies program. My goal
      ever since I was a little kid was to be a software developer.
      I believe my love for technology and computers started when I was
      a young boy. I sat infront of our big clunky Windows PC for hours
      just messing around with anything I could find because it was
      so intriguing to me.</p>

      <h2>What skill I offer</h2>
      <p>I currently have a solid foundation of understanding for the command
      line, the use of git and how to react when running into certain situations
      with git, how to write semantic HTML, and a solid groundwork of CSS.
