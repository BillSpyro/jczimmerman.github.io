    <!-- INTRO AREA -->
    <article id="intro" class="intro-content">

      <h2 class="intro-header">Hey!</h2>
      <p>I am Joey. I am 20 years old, born and raised in Willow Street,
          Pennsylvania. I graduated from Lampeter-Strasburg highschool in 2017.
          I am a student at Thaddeus Stevens, currently
          enrolled in the Computer Software Engineering Technologies program.
          Ever since I was a little kid, I wanted to be a software developer.
          I believe my love for technology and computers started when I was
          a young boy. I remember sitting infront of our big clunky Windows
          PC for hours just messing around with anything I could find, and trying
          to figure out how it worked because it was so intriguing to me. I
          still have that same passion and drive for learning about technology
          today.</p>

      <p>Going to Thaddeus Stevens has been an awesome privilege. I've
          never been more excited about going to a class and learning. I'm
          very excited to see where my path after this program leads me.</p>

        <h3>CSS Layouts</h3>
        <p>The task at hand was to recreate snapshots of websites using just CSS
        and HTML. This taught the importance of using semantic HTML, and to make
        use of good selectors. You can find this project
        <a href="https://github.com/jczimmerman/more-css-practice">here</a>.</p>

      <section class="project-description responsive-layout">
        <h3>Responsive Challenges</h3>
        <p>The task this time was to use the given HTML to make a responsive page.
        We could only add rulesets in media queries that we made. This helped to
        understand the use of media queries. you can find this project
